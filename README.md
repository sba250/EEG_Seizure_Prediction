This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for detecting epileptic seizures from Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals. Epilepsy affects millions worldwide, and early seizure detection can significantly reduce injury risks and improve patient quality of life. Our system processes raw EEG data, extracts relevant features, trains multiple classification models, and provides predictions through both programmatic and web interfaces.
